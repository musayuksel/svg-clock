# SVG Clock

## Description

A project worked on in the north-west-homework-club by members of the class north-west-4.

The aim was to use JavaScript to draw an SVG analogue style clock and manipulate it with JavaScript so that it displays the current time.  

The project was an exercise in building something from scratch and solving problems along the way and also a chance to apply
some of the concepts learned in the previous modules: 

* Git/GitHub
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript Core 1 & 2

The project makes use of the following: 

* SVG
* SVG Viewbox
* SVG namespace
* ES6 Modules (import/export)
* requestAnimationFrame
* for and for-in loops
* template literal strings
* Object destructuring
* The built in Date Object
* CSS transforms
*  remainder operator 
*  ternary operator
